# OOP CRUD 
Simple OOP CRUD Backend (Books API)

This is a small backend project I made for the SESD Workshop Assignment.
The goal was to build a clean OOP-based CRUD API (other than Todo) using Node.js + TypeScript + MongoDB.

I kept the project simple but added all the required features like CRUD.
